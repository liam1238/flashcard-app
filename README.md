# Categories Flashcards Game!

In this project, iv'e created a react app that generates questions (by category and number which the user choose) and displays them as a flashcards.

Every card in the grid has mutiple answers to every question (that generates from "opentdb" api) and when the user click on a card - it's flipped and show the right answer.

Iv'e created 3 diffrent components to create this app and used react hooks, like: useState, useEffect and useRef.
